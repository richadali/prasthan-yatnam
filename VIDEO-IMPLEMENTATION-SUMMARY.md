# Video Implementation Summary

## Overview of Changes

We've completely revamped the video handling system to support local video uploads and secure streaming. Here's a summary of the changes:

### 1. Database Changes

-   Added new columns to `discourse_videos` table:
    -   `video_path`: Path to the stored video file
    -   `video_filename`: Original filename of the uploaded video
    -   `thumbnail_path`: Path to the generated thumbnail
    -   `mime_type`: MIME type of the video file
    -   `file_size`: Size of the video file in bytes
    -   `is_processed`: Flag indicating if the video has been processed
    -   Made `youtube_video_id` nullable to support both YouTube and local videos

### 2. Video Processing

-   Created `VideoProcessingService` to handle video uploads
-   Implemented FFmpeg integration for:
    -   Video compression with reasonable defaults
    -   Thumbnail generation
    -   Duration extraction
-   Added progress tracking for video uploads

### 3. Video Playback

-   Integrated Video.js for a clean, customizable player
-   Applied the "forest" theme for better aesthetics
-   Implemented support for both YouTube and local videos in the same interface

### 4. Access Control

-   Created a secure streaming controller for paid videos
-   Free videos are served directly from public storage
-   Paid videos are streamed through a controller that checks purchase status
-   Added support for video seeking with range requests

### 5. User Interface

-   Updated the video upload interface with:
    -   Drag and drop support
    -   Upload progress indicator
    -   Tab-based selection between YouTube and local uploads
    -   Video preview functionality

## Technical Details

### Video Processing Flow

1. User uploads a video file
2. File is temporarily stored
3. FFmpeg processes the video (compression, thumbnail generation)
4. Processed video is stored in public storage
5. Video metadata is updated in the database

### Secure Streaming Flow

1. User requests a video
2. System checks if the video is free or paid
3. For free videos, direct access is provided
4. For paid videos, purchase status is verified
5. If authorized, the video is streamed with proper headers for seeking

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for adaptive streaming (HLS/DASH)
2. Implement video transcoding to multiple qualities
3. Add watermarking for paid videos
4. Implement client-side encryption for additional security
