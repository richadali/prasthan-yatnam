            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Privileged to be born in a clan wherein I have grown up with vivid 
            memories of my paternal grandfather Tonkeswar Sharma ringing the ghonta (bell) in 
            adoration of Lord Narayan (Saligram) in the Guxai Ghor (room for prayer) and my 
            maternal grandfather Shankardhar Barooah in meditative contemplation penning down 
            “The Vedanta in New Light”, coupled with the cosmopolitan ambience flavoured with 
            traditional roots provided by my parents Girindranath Sharma and Nilima Sharma I 
            have embarked on a different journey in life.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Concept of Prasthan Yatnam:</h2>
            <p> I realized the need for a platform as an aftercare 
            for a lot of people and also for family/ friends/ associates and anyone else who needs it 
            for developing meaning and purpose in life.
            Being spiritually inclined, I often go for many camps/ discourses/ workshops on 
            positive living etc. conducted by all kinds of institutions to pick up the gems for 
            myself and my loved ones. Therein I realized that generally every institution barring a 
            limited few, try to thrust down their ideologies on the buffet era people!! Thus the, 
            idea of Prasthan Yatnam was born within me, influenced greatly by the all embracing
            Sanatan Dharma.</p>

            <h2>What is Prasthan Yatnam:</h2>
            <p>It is a humble endeavor to develop a movement wherein 
            every Thursday members gather to sit in group meditation with the music of different 
            sects. Thereafter a brief input is given about the sect whose music is being used, 
            followed by sharing of experiences by the participants. God willing, one day this 
            movement will culminate into an Organisation!!</p>

            <h2>The fourfold Motto:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Spirituality is not religiosity. It is Universality.</li>
              <li>Meditation is the best tool to untangle, tangled emotions leading to freedom and peace.</li>
              <li>Going back to our roots. In today’s world the reverse of the renaissance has 
                become necessary because people have lost their identity and are spiritually 
                bankrupt. The youth are left with no one to really guide them except ‘Google 
                Search’!! People are looking for peace outside whereas peace in an internal business 
                which can be realized through the scriptures which have dynamite messages but 
                unfortunately people have gone far away from them and also sadly the scriptures 
                have been misinterpreted.
                </li>
              <li>Live and Let Live. For Universal Brotherhood of mankind and for International 
                Peace, this principle is an important prerequisite. Hence in Prasthan Yatnam, we 
                learn about every one’s ideology (110 different sects covered till date) and at home 
                one can practice whatever he/she prefers</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Logo and Color:</h2>
            <p>Snow Clad mountain with the Sun Rising. White for Peace. Orange for Brilliance.</p>
            
            <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
            <p>Deeply inspired by the Gyan Yagnas of Revered Swami Chinmayanandaji 
            and the powerful silent meditation of Rishi Aurobindo and The Divine Mother, Secular 
            idea of “Sab ka Malik hai Ek” of Shirdi Sai Baba, thoughts of Buddha/Swami 
            Vivekananda and many other spiritual Giants and also the 12 step principle of 
            “Together we can, alone I cannot”.</p>
            
            <h2>Why the Name:</h2>
            <p>Poignantly influenced by the narration of my mother regarding how at the deathbed of my maternal grandmother, Annapurna Devi, my grandfather bid her farewell with a &apos;bel paat&apos; (a auspicious leaf of the Hindus) and said “Ataire yatra kalot tumi hodai bel paat di bidai di sila, aji tumar aie moha yatrat tumi ai bel paat loi Brahmalookoloi “Prasthan” kora’. during everyone&apos;s journey you have always sent them off with a bel paat. Today on your final journey, take this bel paat and proceed (Prasthan) to (Brahmalook). Thus Prasthan Yatnam, Prasthan (proceed) Yatnam (attempt) An attempt to proceed.</p>
            
            <h2>Membership:</h2>
            <p>Caste/Creed/sect/religion/sex/age/species no bar. Open to like-minded people who want to evolve.</p>
            
            <h2>Vision and Mission of Prasthan Yatnam:</h2>
            <p>In today's world of fast lanes with ever-increasing traffic, pollution has heightened 
            to its peak. Thus Prasthan Yatnam makes an attempt to be an oxygen mask to save one 
            from the compromised air around. It is a kind of a Rainbow Bridge or a Bridge Course 
            or a balanced platform especially for youngsters to have a breath of fresh air amidst the 
            hurry bury of life. Not all are destined nor inclined to climb the lofty spiritual heights 
            of the Himalayas, yet in their hearts, they have a longing for solace.</p>
            <p>In the midst of modern-day living, play and interaction, suddenly something happens 
            within and life seems to take on a more meaningful shade and rays of tranquility seem 
            to sip into our existence. Prasthan Yatnam makes a humble attempt to provide just that</p>
            <p>Universality makes us open-minded to embrace humanity...We are no profound giants 
            but mere commoners who find a balanced meaning and purpose in life no matter what 
            our age, past and backgrounds are.</p>
            <p>Prasthan Yatnam provides that joyous bonhomie. We are waiting to embrace you if 
            you choose to knock our door. We turn noone away.</p>
            <p>Peace, love and healing.</p>
            <p>Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinaha.</p>
