                                        Privileged to be born in a clan wherein I have grown up with vivid
                                        memories of my paternal grandfather Tonkeswar Sharma ringing the ghonta (bell)
                    in adoration of Lord Narayan (Saligram) in the Guxai Ghor (room for prayer) and my
                                        maternal grandfather Shankardhar Barooah in meditative contemplation penning
                    down "The Vedanta in New Light", coupled with the cosmopolitan ambience flavoured
                    with traditional roots provided by my parents Girindranath Sharma and Nilima Sharma I
                                        have embarked on a different journey in life.

                <!-- Concept Section -->
                <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #000080;">The Concept of Prasthan Yatnam:</h3>
                <p>
                                        I realized the need for a platform as an aftercare
                                        for a lot of people and also for family/friends/associates and anyone else who
                    needs it for developing meaning and purpose in life.
                                    </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                                        Being spiritually inclined, I often go for many camps/discourses/workshops on
                                        positive living etc. conducted by all kinds of institutions to pick up the gems
                    for myself and my loved ones. Therein I realized that generally every institution
                    barring a limited few, try to thrust down their ideologies on the buffet era people!! Thus
                    the idea of Prasthan Yatnam was born within me, influenced greatly by the all
                    embracing Sanatan Dharma.

                <p>
                                        It is a humble endeavor to develop a movement wherein
                                        every Thursday members gather to sit in group meditation with the music of
                    different sects. Thereafter a brief input is given about the sect whose music is being
                    used, followed by sharing of experiences by the participants. God willing, one day
                    this movement will culminate into an Organisation!!

                <!-- Motto Section -->
                <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #000080;">The fourfold Motto:</h3>
                <ol class="mb-4">
                    <li>Spirituality is not religiosity. It is Universality.</li>
                    <li>Meditation is the best tool to untangle, tangled emotions leading to freedom and peace.</li>
                    <li>Going back to our roots. In today's world the reverse of the renaissance has become necessary
                        because people have lost their identity and are spiritually bankrupt. The youth are left with no
                        one to really guide them except 'Google Search'!! People are looking for peace outside whereas
                        peace in an internal business which can be realized through the scriptures which have dynamite
                        messages but unfortunately people have gone far away from them and also sadly the scriptures
                        have been misinterpreted.</li>
                    <li>Live and Let Live. For Universal Brotherhood of mankind and for International Peace, this
                        principle is an important prerequisite. Hence in Prasthan Yatnam, we learn about everyone's
                        ideology (110 different sects covered till date) and at home one can practice whatever he/she
                        prefers.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="mb-4">
                                    Poignantly influenced by the narration of my mother regarding how at
                                    the deathbed of my maternal grandmother, Annapurna Devi, my grandfather bid her
                                    farewell with a 'bel paat' (a auspicious leaf of the Hindus) and said "Ataire yatra
                    kalot tumi hodai bel paat di bidai di sila, aji tumar aie moha yatrat tumi ai bel paat loi
                                    Brahmalookoloi "Prasthan" kora'. (during everyone's journey you have always sent
                                    them off with a bel paat. Today on your final journey, take this bel paat and
                    proceed (Prasthan) to (Brahmalook). Thus Prasthan Yatnam, Prasthan (proceed) Yatnam
                                    (attempt) An attempt to proceed.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #000080;">Vision and Mission of Prasthan Yatnam:</h3>
                <p>
                            In today's world of fast lanes with ever-increasing traffic, pollution has heightened
                    to its peak. Thus Prasthan Yatnam makes an attempt to be an oxygen mask to save one
                            from the compromised air around. It is a kind of a Rainbow Bridge or a Bridge Course
                            or a balanced platform especially for youngsters to have a breath of fresh air amidst the
                            hurry bury of life. Not all are destined nor inclined to climb the lofty spiritual heights
                    of the Himalayas, yet in their hearts, they have a longing for solace.
                        </p>
                <p>
                            In the midst of modern-day living, play and interaction, suddenly something happens
                    within and life seems to take on a more meaningful shade and rays of
                    tranquility seem to sip into our existence. Prasthan Yatnam makes a humble attempt to provide just
                    that.
                </p>
                <p>
                            Universality makes us open-minded to embrace humanity...We are no profound giants
                            but mere commoners who find a balanced meaning and purpose in life no matter what
                    our age, past and backgrounds are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prasthan Yatnam provides that joyous bonhomie. We are waiting to embrace you if
                    you choose to knock our door. We turn noone away.
