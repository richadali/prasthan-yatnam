                <p class="mb-4">
                    Privileged to be born in a clan wherein I have grown up with vivid memories of my paternal
                    grandfather Tonkeswar Sharma ringing the ghonta (bell) in adoration of Lord Narayan (Saligram) in
                    the Guxai Ghor (room for prayer) and my maternal grandfather Shankardhar Barooah in meditative
                    contemplation penning down ‘The Vedanta in New Light’ coupled with the cosmopolitan ambience
                    flavoured with traditional roots provided by my parents Girindranath Sharma and Nilima Sharma, I
                    have embarked on a different journey in life.

                </p>

                <!-- Concept Section -->
                <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #000080;">The Concept of Prasthan Yatnam:</h3>
                <p>
                    I realized the need for a platform as an aftercare for a lot of people and also for family/ friends/
                    associates and anyone else who needs it for developing meaning and purpose in life.

                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Being spiritually inclined, I often go for many camps/ discourses/ workshops on positive living etc.
                    conducted by all kinds of institutions to pick up the gems for myself and my loved ones. Therein I
                    realized that generally every institution, barring a limited few, tries to thrust down their
                    ideologies on the buffet era people!! Thus, the idea of <strong>Prasthan Yatnam (PY)</strong> was
                    born within me,
                    influenced greatly by the all-embracing Sanatan Dharma.

                </p>

                <!-- What is Section -->
                <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #000080;">What is Prasthan Yatnam:</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a humble endeavor to develop a movement wherein, every Thursday, members gather to sit in
                    group meditation with the music of different sects. Thereafter, a brief input is given about the
                    sect whose music is being used, followed by the sharing of experiences by the participants. PY was
                    established on the 9th of May, 2013, and with the blessings of GOD, it has now been registered as a
                    society [October 2022].

                <!-- Motto Section -->
                <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #000080;">The fourfold Motto:</h3>
                <ol class="mb-4" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">
                    <li>Spirituality is not religiosity. It is Universality.</li>
                    <li>Meditation is the best tool to untangle tangled emotions, leading to freedom and peace.
                    </li>
                    <li>Going back to our roots. In today's world, the reverse of the renaissance has become necessary
                        because people have lost their identity and are spiritually bankrupt. The youth are left with no
                        one to really guide them except 'Google Search'!! People are looking for peace outside, whereas
                        peace is an internal business which can be realized through the scriptures, which have dynamite
                        messages, but unfortunately, people have gone far away from them, and also sadly, the scriptures
                        have been misinterpreted.
                    </li>
                    <li>Live and Let Live. For Universal Brotherhood of mankind and for International Peace, this
                        principle is an important prerequisite. Here, in PY, we learn about everyone's ideology [124
                        different sects covered till date], and at home, one can practice whatever one prefers.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Poignantly influenced by the narration of my mother regarding how at the deathbed of my maternal
                    grandmother, Annapurna Devi, my grandfather bid her farewell with a '<a

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #000080;">Vision and Mission of Prasthan Yatnam:</h3>
                <p>
                    In today's world of fast lanes with ever-increasing traffic, pollution has reached its peak. Thus,
                    PY makes a sincere attempt to be an oxygen mask to save one from the compromised air around. It is a
                    kind of a <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainbow Bridge</span></em><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> or a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridge
                            Course</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a balanced platform, especially for
                        youngsters to have a breath of fresh air amidst the hurry-burry of life. Not all are destined or
                        inclined to climb the lofty spiritual heights of the Himalayas, yet in their hearts, they have a
                        longing for solace.</span>

                </p>
                <p>
                    In the midst of modern-day living, play and interaction, suddenly something happens within, and life
                    seems to take on a more meaningful shade, and rays of tranquility seem to seep into our existence.
                    PY
                    makes a humble attempt to provide just that.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Universality</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes us open-minded to embrace
                        humanity. We are no profound giants but mere commoners who find a balanced </span><em><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;">meaning and purpose </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">in
                        life, no matter what our age, past and backgrounds are.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    PY provides that joyous bonhomie. We are waiting to embrace you if you choose to knock on our door.
                    We turn no one away.
